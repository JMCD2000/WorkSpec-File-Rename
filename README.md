# WorkSpec-File-Rename
This copies and renames selected folder contents.

This was developed because of a large amount of files that needed to have standardized naming convention. Project started in December of 2018. This is nothing fancy, and is a script to correct and affix a hull number and availibilty with the work spec number and the work item..
